## Visual/alignment regression: placeables and player model

Reported: 2026-05-24 during the recurring `continue-ee-bridge-dev` automation.

Symptoms:
- Some chests/placeables appear randomly rotated.
- Some non-trapped chests/placeables appear with trapped visuals.
- The player character model can appear as a bird even when the selected
  character should not be a bird.

Current status:
- Treat this as a suspected packet reader/writer alignment bug, not as a
  cosmetic asset issue.
- The source character seed is probably not the cause of the bird model:
  `C:\NWN\NWN Diamond\servervault\Starcore5\starcore-druid60.bic` and
  `C:\NWN\NWN Diamond\localvault\druid.bic` both report
  `Appearance_Type = 2`, `Race = 2`, `Gender = 1`, and `Phenotype = 0`.
  That points the player-model symptom toward live-object current-player
  add/appearance translation unless later BIC/CharList evidence proves
  otherwise.
- Do not promote new live-object or area fixtures as positive coverage when
  the only proof is that the EE byte-shape validator accepts them. These
  symptoms show that exact byte-shape can still be semantically wrong if a
  field cursor is shifted before appearance, trap/static state, orientation, or
  creature appearance/model fields.
- A 2026-05-24 local Chapter2 harness run
  `C:\nwnbridge\local-diamond-bridge-20260524-210621` reached gameplay with no
  root quarantine and produced accepted-live-object diagnostics, but those
  diagnostics were intentionally not promoted because of this report.

Most likely packet families to audit:
- `P/04/01 Area_ClientArea`: static placeable rows and module-resource-backed
  repairs. Check appearance, static/trap flags, and orientation fields against
  the exact Diamond and EE area readers.
- `P/05/01 GameObjUpdate_LiveObject`: placeable add/update tails, object visual
  transform insertion, scalar orientation bits, and current-player creature
  appearance records.
- `P/11/04 CharList_UpdateCharResponse` and local BIC handling only if the
  player appearance is already wrong before the first live-object current-player
  update.

Proof required before fixing:
- Capture/compare local Diamond baseline, local EE bridge output, and ideally
  EE reader/writer decompile evidence for the exact field order.
- Add semantic assertions for at least one affected fixture: placeable
  appearance id, trap/static state, orientation/bearing, and player
  `Appearance_Type`/model must match the Diamond source intent after rewrite.
- Keep the fix bounded to the responsible family. Do not raw-passthrough,
  relax exact validation, or add broad appearance/trap heuristics.
